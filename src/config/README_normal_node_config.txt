# The normal node gets its configuration from a text file
# The text file contains the keys for the interests and after that
# the values the node is interested in
# For numeric values the type is specified (greater,lower)
# For strings just example values are generated, so a typical config
# file looks like this:

<key>   <variable_type>  <interest_type>    <possible values...>
