# Test the application for different parameters

You can run any of the test files, to simulate the blockchain application running with different parameters.
The results given will be placed in the corresponding output folders, in different subfolders, as text files, for further
analysis or plotting.
The kind of results that you get are specified be the name of the tests.

# What these tests do
These tests provide txt files, which will be located in the corresponding output folders.
In these files, there are columns for each block size or range of blocksizes, separated by a single space character.
The first row contains the label (block sizes) for the result columns.

# How to use these tests
Each test has a main method. Because this project is part of my graduation thesis, I simply edited the distributions and sizes I
wanted, which were placed in arrays. This means that I edited the code by hand for each test I wanted to do. Because of this and 
the lack of available time, there is not anything like a config file that can be used for this purpose.
