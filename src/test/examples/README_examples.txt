The example files contain some specific examples of blockchain environments.
More specifically, they contain the structure of a transaction and the possible
values that each variable of the transaction can have.

The structure of the example file is as follows:

For string variables:

<variable_name>     <variable_type>     <possible_values>

For numeric variables:

<variable_name>     <variable_type>

Numeric values can possibly have a min or max value associated with them.
